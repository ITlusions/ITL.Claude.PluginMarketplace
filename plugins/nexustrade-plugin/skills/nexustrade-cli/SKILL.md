name: nexustrade-cli
description: Run the NexusTrade monitoring CLI (`nexustrade`) for a stock watchlist - buy-ladder levels and alerts, one-shot price alerts, big-player gainers screen, signal journal, performance ranking, tool inventory. Use for scheduled checks (LADDER ALERT CHECK, PRICE ALERT CHECK, GAINERS CHECK, DAILY LADDER RECOMPUTE, SIGNAL JOURNAL UPDATE) and "how did X perform" questions. READ-ONLY, never places orders.

# nexustrade CLI

Read-only wrapper over the official `webull-cli` binary. It never places, modifies or cancels an order. Do not use any other Webull client.

## Install and run

The package is NOT bundled with this plugin. It lives in the user's own `nexustrade-cli` folder (a Python package named `nexustrade`).

```
pip install -e <path-to>/nexustrade-cli         # once; add [charts] for matplotlib
nexustrade <command>                            # or: python -m nexustrade <command>
```

Environment:
- `NEXUSTRADE_HOME` - folder with `config.json`, `levels.json`, `state.json`, `price_alerts*.json`, `journal.jsonl`. Default `~/.nexustrade`. Point it at an existing scripts folder to share state with legacy scripts.
- `WEBULL_CLI` - path to the webull binary. Default `%USERPROFILE%\.webull\webull-cli.exe`.

Run `nexustrade status` first if unsure what exists.

## Commands

| Command | Use | Writes state |
|---|---|---|
| `ladder check` | LADDER ALERT CHECK. Prints triggered rungs or "NO NEW TRIGGERS" | yes |
| `ladder recompute` | DAILY LADDER RECOMPUTE of ATR rungs into `levels.json` | yes |
| `alerts check` | PRICE ALERT CHECK. Prints new triggers or "NO NEW TRIGGERS" | yes |
| `alerts status` | Show each alert: armed or FIRED | no |
| `alerts reset` | Re-arm alerts. Only when the user asks | yes |
| `gainers` | Large (cap >= $10B), liquid gainers for the current session, with tracked/watch flags | no |
| `journal log TICKER VERDICT REF [--entry --stop --t1 --t2 --src --note --date]` | Log a signal | yes |
| `journal evaluate` | Score logged signals at 5 and 20 days | yes |
| `journal report` | Show journal results | no |
| `rank [TICKERS] [--periods D...] [--benchmarks T...] [--sort D] [--json]` | Trailing performance vs benchmarks | no |
| `status [--only live\|tool\|experimental\|research\|archived]` | Tool inventory from `metadata.json` | no |

## Rules for checks

- Chat-only checks (ladder, price, gainers): no cache file, no git.
- "NO NEW TRIGGERS": reply with one short line.
- Ladder trigger: report ticker, level, price and tranche shares. Remind to cancel the lowest rung if the one above closes broken, and to stop near the final rung.
- Watch-only tickers (for example AMD) are never traded. A breakout counts only on a daily close above the level on higher volume.
- Gainers: after the screen, look up news for the printed tickers, then a short table. SKIP gets one line.
- Never run state-writing commands as "tests" - they alter live alert and ladder state.

## Parsing tips

- Use `--json` where offered (`rank`). Other commands print plain text; quote lines, do not reinterpret numbers.
- webull-cli sometimes returns non-JSON under load; the package retries 3 times. If it still fails, say so instead of guessing prices.
